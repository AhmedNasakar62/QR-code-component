## Overview

A QR-code component built using only HTML and CSS with a minimum DRY(Don't repeat yourself) code.

### What I learned

CSS is a tool which in hand of it wielder can be used to design web pages in different ways free from monopoly. Most times i can't really say i do know what to write but upon starting i come to find myself writing just the very solution to a problem in my own way.

### Continued development

The journey is still a bit far since with every passing day new technologies are been released for easier development which every conscious developer should know how to use at least a few if not all.
